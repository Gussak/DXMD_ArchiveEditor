# DXMD_ArchiveEditor

I consider this a generic binary mod merger tool.  
I am trying to expand it.  
This tool can also be used to merge binary patch mods to any other games or other files in DXMD.  

How to auto compile and run it:  
`./jarAndRunIt.sh` in linux  
`jarAndRunIt.bat` in windows (ISSUE: help needed, I dont know how to code that file but should be equivalent of what is at jarAndRunIt.sh)  

How to improve it: edit the patcher offsets and hex values at GameDataDXMD.java.  
Obs.: a file equivalent to GameDataDXMD.java can be used to patch other games binary files.  

Run it with OpenJDK11: `java -jar DXMD_ArchiveEditor.jar`
