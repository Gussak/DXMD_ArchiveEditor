# DXMD_ArchiveEditor

I consider this a generic binary mod merger tool.  
I am trying to expand it.  
This tool can also be used to merge binary patch mods to any other games or other files in DXMD.  

.How to improve it: edit MainGUI.java fillOptionDataDXMD() database,  
then compile it with: `javac MainGUI.java`  
.Now drag MainGUI.class and MainGUI$1.class ... into the jar file (that is just a zip renamed to .jar),  
or run `./jarAndRunIt.sh` in linux  
or `jarAndRunIt.bat` in windows (ISSUE: help needed, I dont know how to code that file but should be equivalent of what is at jarAndRunIt.sh)  

Run it with OpenJDK11: `java -jar DXMD_ArchiveEditor.jar`
