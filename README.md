# DXMD_ArchiveEditor

I consider this a generic binary mod merger tool.
I am trying to expand it.
This tool can also be used to merge binary patch mods to any other games or other files in DXMD.

How to use: edit MainGUI.java then compile it with: javac MainGUI.java  
Now drag MainGUI.class into a jar file containing all files here (that is just a zip renamed to .jar) and run it with OpenJDK11.
